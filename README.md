# min-c-interpreter
A C-like language interpreter I wrote 1 or 2 years ago...

It was written before I really knew about OOP and design patterns, so it's mostly written in C-style.

I couldn't find the final version of it, so it's full of bugs and cannot pass several test cases.

I will fix it, if I have time...

To compile and run:

```
clang++ -std=c++11 interpreter.cpp -o interpreter
./interpreter [source file]
```

The syntax description will be uploaded if I can find it.
